<h5 id="tribute-info">Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone  (born July 6, 1946) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer. He is well known for his Hollywood action roles, including boxer Rocky Balboa in the Rocky series (1976–2018), soldier John Rambo in the five Rambo films (1982–2019), mercenary Barney Ross in the three The Expendables films (2010–2014) and structure engineer Ray Breslin in the three Escape Plan films (2013-2019). He wrote or co-wrote most of the 16 films in the first three popular franchises and directed many of them.<br>
Stallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. His use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps, and Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. It was announced on December 7, 2010, that he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the non-participant category.<br>
In 1977, Stallone was nominated for two Academy Awards for Rocky, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. He became the third man in history to receive these two nominations for the same film, after Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles. He received positive reviews, as well as his first Golden Globe Award win and a third Academy Award nomination, for reprising the role of Rocky Balboa in Ryan Coogler's 2015 film Creed.<br>
Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone was born in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, on July 6, 1946, the elder son of Francesco "Frank" Stallone Sr., a hairdresser and beautician, and Jacqueline "Jackie" Stallone (née Labofish; born 1921), an astrologer, dancer, and promoter of women's wrestling. His Italian father was born in Gioia del Colle and moved to the U.S. in the 1930s,[8][9] while his American mother is of French (from Brittany) and Ukrainian-Jewish (from Odessa) descent.His younger brother is actor and musician Frank Stallone.

Complications suffered by Stallone's mother during labor forced her obstetricians to use two pairs of forceps during his birth; misuse of these forceps accidentally severed a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of Stallone's face. As a result, the lower left side of his face is paralyzed (including parts of his lip, tongue, and chin), an accident which gave him his signature snarling look and slurred speech.He was baptized Catholic.[18] His father moved the family to Washington, D.C. in the early 1950s to open a beauty school. In 1954, his mother opened a women's gym called Barbella's. Stallone attended Notre Dame Academy and Lincoln High School in Philadelphia,[20] as well as Charlotte Hall Military Academy, prior to attending Miami Dade College and the University of Miami.<br>
In 1972, Stallone appeared in the film No Place to Hide, which was re-cut and retitled Rebel, the second version featuring Stallone as its star. After the style of Woody Allen's What's Up, Tiger Lily?, this film, in 1990, was re-edited from outtakes from the original movie and newly shot matching footage, then redubbed into an award-winning parody of itself titled A Man Called...
